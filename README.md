# End-to-End Optimized Speech Coding with Deep Neural Networks

Presented at ICASSP 2018.

This code is very messy right now, and some work needs to be done to clean it up. More info about how to run it / reproduce results / etc. is coming soon. I believe all of the most important information (including hyperparameters) is in the paper, however.
